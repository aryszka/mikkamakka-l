[parser]
- tokenization and tree parsing separate
- tokens always first, e.g. with tokens -, <, <- and symbol, and parsing rules expression = [symbol],
  receive = (<- expression), less-operation (expression < expression) and negative-value = (- expression), the
  sequence a<-b won't parse as a less then minus b, because <- will be parsed as its own token
- simple tokens
- more complext tokens

buzz:
- simple user interface for parsing
- can be used as a prototyping parser to test dsl concepts before implementing a specialized parser
